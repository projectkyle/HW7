The effect of macroeconomic conditions on parental time with children: evidence from the American time use survey

Using American Time Use Survey (ATUS) data from 2003-2013, the researchers study the correlation between macroeconomic conditions and the amount of time mothers and fathers spend with children. A number of demographic characteristics are accounted for such as race and region. The results indicate that higher state level unemployment rates tend to increase quality child-father time in families with younger children from ages 0-4. Results also indicate that higher unemployment rates also correlate to an increase in primary care for fathers in families with young children and a decrease in time spent with older children. On the other hand, unemployment rates generally seem to have no significant affect on women and time spent with young children, with the exception of white women, who seem to spend less time with young children as unemployment rates go up.


The effect of working from home on major time allocations with a focus on food-related activities

This study uses data from working-age adults (age 25–54 years old) who participated in the 2017–18 Leave and Job Flexibilities Module of the American Time Use Survey to identify correlations between time spent on work and work location (work from home or away from home). The findings suggest that those who work from home allocate their time differently than those working away and that those working from home spend more time on leisure, sleeping, cooking, and eating. For example, those who lived with a spouse or partner spend 25 more minutes cooking/preparing food and 48 more minutes eating. The results can various implecations/insights. In the previous example, it can be assumed that those who work from home eat better meals than those who don't and therefore are overall more healthy.
